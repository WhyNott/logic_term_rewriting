  Predicates:
    - (0) is a natural number
    -
      (s of ?X) is a natural number:
        and:
          - ?X is a natural number
        
    -
      (0) + ?X = ?X:
        and:
          - ?X is a natural number
        
    -
      (s of ?X) + ?Y = (s of ?Z):
        and:
          - ?X + ?Y = ?Z


    - (0) * ?X = (0)

    -
      (s of ?X) * ?Y = ?Z:
        and:
          - ?X * ?Y = ?XY
          - ?XY + ?Y = ?Z


    - factorial of (0) is (s of (0))
    
    -
      factorial of (s of ?N) is ?F:
        and:
          - factorial of ?N is ?F1
          - (s of ?N) * ?F1 = ?F
